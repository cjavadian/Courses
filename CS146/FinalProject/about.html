    <section id="about">
    <p>Our company was formed in 2014 by a group of college freshman.  We are very serious about innovating the process companies use to develop new technology and we're going to start with smartphones.  We feel that it is important to get user input when coming up with a new products.  In order to know what to include in our cell phones, computers, and tablets, we ask the user what they would like to see.  We allow the people to be the innovators and creative force and us to be the technical minds.</p>

    <p id="q1">Who are we?</p>
    <p id="ans1">Established in October of 2014, we are a group of college freshmen who got fed up with debating the pros and cons found on Apple and Andriod (but specifically not Windows) smart phones. David Estrada, Matt McCreesh, Brandon Cheung, Mark Spaloss, and Jennifer Cafiero comprise this development team. </p>
    <p id="q2">Why has no one else done this before?</p>
    <p id="ans2">I still have no idea, sorry.</p>
    <p id="q3">When will our product be released?</p>
    <p id="ans3">We are hoping to finish collecting data from customers by the end of 2014. The phone will be developed and the projected release is for winter 2015.</p>
